<h2 id="cyber">CyberPatriot</h2>
<br>
<p>CyberPatriot is known as the National Youth Cyber Education Program that deals with cyber security and web protection.
   At the center of CyberPatriot is the National Youth Cyber Defense Competition, where they put teams of high school
   and middle school students in charge of managing the network of a small company. In the rounds of competition, teams are
   given a set of problems and tasks that must be completed in a six hour period. All the while hardening and trying to find ways
   to make it overall a better program by the end. The team with the best all around network is the winner. Here at West we have a
   team who happily competes and always is in it to win it! We have competitions almost every month of the year, feel free to come
   help and support us! </p>

<h2 id="proj">Projects</h2>
  <br>

<p>One of our major projects in the works right now is our West High School App! This app includes; a bell schedule
for everyone who always wonders, an activity calander to find out when games, breaks, and dances are, an exclusive
tab on the sports teams including their wins and game highlights of the best moments, and finally a way to check
your Falcon Flex schedule and Grades fast and easy! And the makers of it all are the Capstone Creations!
<br><br>
It's a no-brainer to get this app once it's released. For Andriod users, you could get this app by Christmas of 2017!
But sadly, if you are an iPhone user you'll probably have to wait until the school year of 2018-19. Sorry! :(</p>
